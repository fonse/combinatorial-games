See [ HACKENBUSH: a window to a new world of math ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj4NkeGPdM) for a fantastic introduction to combinatorial game theory.

This is a Haskell implementation of a combinatorial game as defined in Winning Ways, to help with the arithmetic of adding and simplifying games.
